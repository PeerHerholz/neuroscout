# Using neuroscout.org

This user guide will walk you through the [neuroscout.org](https://neuroscout.org) web interface, the primary way you'll interact with Neuroscout.

The first aspect we will cover is the analysis builder, which allows you to:

  - Create a custom fMRI analysis from scratch, drawing from hundreds of extracted predictors.
  - Modify predictors by applying transformations, such as scaling and hemodynamic convolution.
  - Define custom contrasts.
  - Iteratively review and modify the statistical model and design matrix.
  - Generate an executable analysis bundle.

Once you've learned how to build your own analysis, we'll discuss:

  - Browsing and managing analyses (public and private)
  - Cloning existing analyses to create a forked analysis
  - Viewing and sharing uploaded results
  - Uploading custom predictors

## Sign Up

First things first, you need to register for an account.

Currently, there are two supported options, the choice is yours!

- Create an account using an email address and password (old fashioned way).
- Use Google single sign on.

If you create an account with us, you'll be asked to validate your email, as usual.


!!! Note
    Accounts are linked using email addresses. Signing up twice using the same email address, will result in a single account.


## Ready to begin?

Once you've logged in, you can launch the [analysis builder](builder.md) using the `New Analysis` navigation button.

You can use the `Browse` button to view analyses you've created by selecting `My Analyses`, or publicly shared analyses under `Public analyses`.
Note that you don't need to log in to view public analyses.

Let's get started by creating an analysis using the [builder](builder.md).
