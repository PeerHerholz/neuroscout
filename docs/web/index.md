# Using neuroscout.org

This tutorial will guide you through the [neuroscout.org](https://neuroscout.org) web interface.

We will cover the various steps of creating a custom analysis, as well as browsing, managing and cloning existing analyses.

## Sign Up

First things first, you need to register for an account.

Currently there are two supported sign up options:

- Create an account using an email address and password (old fashioned way)
- Use Google single sign on.

The choice is yours, but be aware that accounts are linked using email addresses.
Signing up twice using the same email address, will only result in a single account.

## Ready to begin?

Once you've logged in, you can launch the analysis builder using the "New Analysis" navigation button.

You can use the "Browse" button to view view analyses you've created by selecting "My Analyses", or publicly shared analyses under "Public analyses".
Note that you don't need to log in to view public analyses.

Next, let's dive into creating an analysis using the [builder](builder.md).
