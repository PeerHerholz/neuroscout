# Introduction

## What is Neuroscout?

Neuroscout is a web-based platform for fast and flexible analysis of fMRI data.

## Motivation

fMRI studies using complex naturalistic stimulation, such as movies or audio narratives, hold great promise to reveal the neural activity underlying dynamic real-world perception. However, this potential utility is constrained by the resource-intensive nature of fMRI analysis, and further exacerbated by the difficulty of encoding relevant events in rich, multi-modal stimuli.

Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art feature extraction tools to automatically extract hundreds of annotations from stimuli. We pair this with a flexible and easy-to-use web interface, enabling researchers to flexibly define and explore novel theoretical models.

Analysis execution is achieved with no configuration using open neuroimaging standards, and containerized model-fitting pipelines, ensuring high portability across execution environments, including HPCs and the cloud. Finally, we make it easy for researchers to share their results with interactive publication-like reports via the NeuroVault repository.

## Where can I get more help?

In this documentation, we'll walk you through building and executing your own analysis on [neuroscout.org](https://neuroscout.org).
In addition, the first time you use neuroscout.org, you will be given a tour of the interface. After the tour, be on the look out informational tooltips ("i" icon), provided throughout to clarify
 aspects of the user interface. Finally, please read the [FAQ](faq.md) thoroughly!

For usage questions not addressed here, please ask a question on  [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org). For bug reports, feature requests, feedback, etc.,
please open an issue on [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/neuroscout/neuroscout/issues).
